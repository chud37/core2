## A simple and easy to use website structure

Core2 is designed to run straight out of the box.  Simply clone and you're good to go.

## Motivation

Core2 is designed to be a simple framework.  I wanted a framework that would contain all the pages in a single folder, with each page loading its own CSS, JS and configuration files.  Page folders are then easily copied to other websites making for easy duplications.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your public_html folder by running the following command:

```
clone https://github.com/chud37/core2.git .
```

**Note:** The period at the end of the command means that it will clone into the current directory.  If you need to, replace this with your public website directory.
